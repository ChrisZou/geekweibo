## What's this?
This is a place where you can save and share scratches of technical notes. You can think of this as "Twitter for programmers".

## Why？
I've always wanted a place where I can quickly and convinently save some short technical notes. But I haven't found one that suits my need. Twitter is nearest to what I want, but it doesn't render markdown, so the experience is not idea for viewing notes. Also, I haven't found a CLI for twitting that I'm satisfying with, and I don't want to visit twitter.com just for sending a quick tweet.
